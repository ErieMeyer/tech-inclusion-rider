# Tech Inclusion Rider template

This is an adaptation of [USC's inclusion rider template](http://assets.uscannenberg.org.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/inclusion-rider-template.pdf), originally designed for television and film, designed for technologists.

This work builds on the smart writing and thinking of Sabrina Hersi Issa, Nicole Sanchez, and Sarah Schacht.
